# This is a file that configures SOPS to assume it should use a specific keyring
# and key if encrypting a new file. If it is to decrypt an existing file, that
# information will be available as metadata and this is not needed.
#
# To authenticate yourself sufficiently:
#
#   gcloud auth login
#   gcloud auth application-default login
#
# To setup a new keyring and key:
#
#   gcloud kms keyrings create nh-2020 --location global
#   gcloud kms keyrings list --location global
#   gcloud kms keys create main --location global --keyring nh-2020 --purpose encryption
#   gcloud kms keys list --location global --keyring nh-2020
#
# To encrypt a new file:
#
#   sops --encrypt --in-place deployments/hub.neurohackademy.org/secrets/prod.yaml
#
# To edit an encrypted file:
#
#   sops deployments/hub.neurohackademy.org/secrets/prod.yaml
